The color property of CSS helps to set the color of the HTML element(s). 
This helps to _set the foreground color of text, text decorations, and borders_.

Syntax:

```css
/* Syntax
selector {
    color: value
} 
*/

selector {
    /* colorname can be any colour, such as red, blue, yellow, purple, green, etc. */
    color: colorname
}
```
**Note**: In CSS we use **color,** not colour.

# Ways to add colour:

In CSS we have these methods to add colours:-
	1. [[4. Color is CSS#Pre-defined Name|Pre-defined Name]]
	2. [[4. Color is CSS#Hexadecimal notation|Hexadecimal notation]]
	3. [[4. Color is CSS#RGB|RGB]]
	4. [[4. Color is CSS#RGBA|RGBA]]
	5. [[4. Color is CSS#HSL|HSL]]
	6. [[4. Color is CSS#HSLA|HSLA]]

## Pre-defined Name 

The first method of defining the colour in the CSS is _directly writing the particular colour name_.

Example:
```html
<head>
    <style>
        p{
            color: purple;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Hello World</p>
    <p>CodeWithHarry</p>
</body>

</html>
```

Output:
![[color_name.png|700]]

<big>There are many ways to set the property-value of color, with some of the most common listed below:</big>

## Hexadecimal notation:

The hex code consists of a hash(#) symbol followed by six characters. These six characters are arranged into a set of three pairs (RR, GG, and BB).

Each character pair defines the intensity level of the colour, where R stands for red, G stands for green, and B stands for blue.

The intensity value lies between 00 (no intensity) and ff (maximum intensity).

Breaking the Character Set (RRGGBB):

-   **RR**: RR defines the intensity of color red, ranging from 00 (no red) to FF (maximum red).
-   **GG**: GG defines the intensity of color Green, with values from 00 (no green) to FF (full green).
-   **BB**: GG defines the intensity of color Blue, varying from 00 (no blue) to FF (full blue).

Syntax:
```css
seletor {
       color: #RRGGBB;
}
```

Example:
```html
<head>
    <style>
       h1 {
            color: #FF0000;
            /*Pure Red*/
        }
        h2 {
            color: #00FF00;
            /* Pure Green */
        }
        h3 {
            color: #0000FF;
            /* Pure Blue */
        }
        h4 {
            color: #b700ff;
            /* Custom Color */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>CodeWithHarry</h1>
    <h2>A Developer</h2>
    <h3>Founder CodeWithHarry.com</h3>
    <h4>Hello World</h4>
</body>
</html>
```

 Output:
 
![[hex.png|700]]

## RGB

_RGB stands for “Red, Green, Blue”_ and 
- it defines the colour value by taking three (red, green, blue) arguments.
- Each argument value lies between 0 and 255.

Syntax:
```css
selector{
       color: rgb(red, green, blue);
}
```

Example:
```html
<head>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
            /* red:0, green:0, blue:0 */
        }

        h2 {
            color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
            /* red:255, green:255, blue:255 */
        }

        h3 {
            color: rgb(30, 150, 220);
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>CodeWithHarry</h1>
    <h2>A Developer</h2>
    <h3>CodeWithHarry.com founder</h3>
</body>

</html>
```

Output:

![[rgb.png|700]]

---
## RGBA

Similar to RGB, in RGBA, **A** stands for alpha value, which defines the opacity of the color. 
- The alpha value lies between 0 and 1.

 Syntax:
```css
selector{
       color: rgb(red, green, blue, opacity);
}
```

 Example:
```html
<head>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
            /* red:0, green:0, blue:0, Alpha: 0.8 = 80% */
        }

        h2 {
            color: rgb(255, 255, 255, 0.6);
            /* red:255, green:255, blue:255 */
        }

        h3 {
            color: rgba(30 150 220 / 60% );
            /* red:30, green:150, blue:200, alpha:60% */
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>CodeWithHarry</h1>
    <h2>A Developer</h2>
    <h3>CodeWithHarry.com founder</h3>
</body>

</html>
```

Output:

![[rgba.png|700]]

## HSL

HSL _stands for hue, saturation, and lightness_. This is another way to set colour properties.

<big>Breaking each keyword:</big>

### Hue(h)

-   Hue represents the type of color. It is measured in degrees, and its value lies from 0 to 360.
-   0 degree represents black, 120 degree is for green, and 360 degree is for blue.
### Saturation (S):

-   Saturation controls the intensity or purity of the color. It is measured in percentage, and its value lies between 0% and 100%.
-   0% saturation is no color (grayscale),  and 100% saturation is the most intense colour.
### Lightness (L):

-   Lightness determines how light or dark the colour is. It is measured in percentage, and its value lies between 0% and 100%.
-   0% lightness represents pure black, 50% lightness represents normal colour, and 100% lightness is pure white.

Syntax:
```css
selector{
       color: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness);
}
```

Example:
```html
<head>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: hsl(235, 100%, 50%);
        }
        p {
            color: hsl(0, 0%, 0%);
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>CodeWithHarry</h1>
    <p>A Developer</p>
</body>

</html>
```

 Output:
 
![[hsl.png|700]]

---
## HSLA

HSLA is similar to HSL;  here, **A** stands for _alpha value_, which is _used to set the opacity_. 
- Alpha values lie between 0 and 1.

 Syntax:
```css
selector{
       color: hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha);
}
```

Example:
```html
<head>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: hsla(235, 100%, 50%, 0.7);
        }
        p {
            color: hsl(0, 0%, 0%, 0.4); /* a for alpha */
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>CodeWithHarry</h1>
    <p>A Developer</p>
</body>

</html>
```

 Output:
 
![[hsla.png|700]]
