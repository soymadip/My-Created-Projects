### Universal Selector

- Universal selector represented by "*****" targets all the HTML elements on the page.
- The syntax of Universal Selector is as follows:

```css
* {
    property : value;
}
```

- Consider the code snippet:

```html
<html>

<head>
    <style>
        * {
            color: purple;
            text-align: center;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Welcome to </p>
    <h1>CodeWithHarry</h1>
</body>

</html>
```

Output:

![[selector-universal.png|600]]

Notice, Irrespective of the tag, the style will be applied to all the elements and tags.

### Element Selector (Type Selector)

- The element selector selects the target element based on the specific type. 
- Suppose you want to underline all the `<p>` tags; in this case, the element selector will be the best choice.
- The syntax of Element Selector is as follows:
	- selector can be any HTML tag. Here, we have considered the p tag.

```css
p {
    property : value;
}
```

- Consider the code snippet:

```html
<html>

<head>
    <title>CSS</title>
    <style>
        p{
            text-decoration: underline;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>CodeWithHarry</h1>
    <h2>we offer: </h2>
    <p>Python Tutorials - 100 Days of Code</p>
    <p>Ultimate JavaScript Course</p>
    <p>React JS Tutorials For Beginners</p>
</body>

</html>
```

- Output:

![[Selector-Element.png|500]]

**Note**: Element selector is not recommended as the same tag can be used multiple times in the document. So, overlapping rules can occur in the stylesheet.

---
### ID Selector

- The ID selector targets the elements based on the specific ID. 
- It is written with the hash **“**#**”** character followed by the ID name in the style sheet.
- The syntax of ID Selector is as follows:

```css
#ID {
    property : value;
}
```

- Consider the code snippet:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        #title {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1 id="title">CodeWithHarry</h1>
    <p>I'm a Developer and the founder of CodeWithHarry.com</p>
</body>

</html>
```

In the style block, the selector  **#title,** will only target the HTML element having an ID of "title".

- Consider the output of the above code:

![[selector-ID.png|600]]

Notice, how the property color: red is only applied to `<h1>` tag.

---
### Class Selector

- The class selector does the same job as the id selector, a class selector helps group various types of elements. 
- Suppose, we want to give a custom style to a specific group of elements. In this case, the class selector is the best option.
- It is written with the period **“****.****”** character followed by the class name in the style sheet.

- The syntax of Class Selector is as follows:

```css
.class {
    property : value;
}
```

Consider the code snippet:

```html
<html>

<head>
    <title>CSS</title>
    <style>
        .red {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <p>This is simple p tag</p>
    <p class="red">This p tag has class red</p>
    <p>This is simple p tag</p>
    <p class="red">This p tag has class red</p>
</body>

</html>
```

In the above code snippet, the color:red will only be applied to the element having class 'red'.

**Note**: The class selector helps in grouping two or more elements.

---
### Group Selector

- The group selector is used to minimise the code. 
- Commas **","** are used to separate each selector in a grouping. This reduces the number of lines of code. The code also looks clean.

The syntax of Group Selector is as follows:

```css
div, p, a {
    property : value;
}
```

Consider the code snippet:

```html
<html>

<head>
    <title>CSS</title>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: red;
        }

        p,a {
            color: purple;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>CodeWithHarry</h1>
    <p>This is the p tag</p>
    <a href="#">This is the anchor (a) tag</a>
</body>

</html>
```

In the `<style>` block, p and a tag are grouped together so, that both tags will have the same properties.

### Attribute Selector

The [attribute] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.


Syntax:- 
```css
 element[attribute] {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

Example:-
```css
a[href="youtube.com"] {
 color: blue;
}
/* all <a> tag with YouTube.com link will be blue */
```
