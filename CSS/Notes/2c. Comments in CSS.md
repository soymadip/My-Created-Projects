# CSS Comments

- Comments help with documentation and are helpful for the future users who read that code, so that they can understand it easily.
- Comments are ignored by the browser and Comments don't affect the styling or layout.
- CSS Comments are enclosed between `/*` & `*/`.
- If you are using [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can use `cltr + /` to comment the line.

- There are two types of comments in CSS:

## Single-line comment:

Single-line comments are contained within one line. They are useful for short annotations.
### Syntax

```css
selector{
    /* property: value */
}
```

for example:

```css
/* This is a single line commnent */

p{
    /* color: red */
}
```

here, the comment is between `/*` and `*/`

---
## Multi-line comments

Multi-line comments span across multiple lines, making them ideal for detailed explanations or temporarily disabling blocks of code.
### Syntax

```css
selector{
    /* property1: value1
    property1: value1
    property1: value1 */
}
```

These are similar to single-line comments, but this helps to comment large descriptions, notes, etc.

for example:

```css
/* This is a
multi line
commment */
p {
    /* color: red;
    background-color: purple; */
    color: purple;
    background-color: red;
}
```
