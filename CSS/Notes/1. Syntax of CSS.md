CSS follows a rule-based structure. Each rule consists of aÂ **selector** and a **declaration** block. Selectors pick the HTML elements, while declaration blocks contain pairs of properties and values.

The general syntax for writing CSS.

![[basic_syntax.png|400]]

```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

**Note**: Semi-colon (`;`) at the end of each new property and property value is *IMPORTANT*.

- For example:

```css
h2{
    color: blue;
}
```

- In the example:
	- **h2**: h2 is the selector.
	- **color**: It's the property.
	- **blue:** The property value.

Within the declaration block, there can be multiple pairs of properties and values.
- Consider the example:

```css
button{
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
    border: transparent;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```
- Here, 'button' is the selector, and there are multiple pairs of properties and values. 
- Each pair is separated by a semicolon "`;`".
