# How do I use(& recomend to use if anyone want) this repo?

- At first fork this repo.
- Clone the repo using **Git**:--
  - For Linux(Ubuntu):-
    
    ```
    sudo apt install git
    git clone https://github.com/soymadip/My-Created-Projects
    ```
  - For Windows (altough i recommend to try using linux):-
    - First install git from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    - then clone:-
      
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/soymadip/My-Created-Projects
      ```
- Now open the cloned `My-Created-Projects` folder in your IDE (I am & recomend using VS Code).
- Open the `PRACTICE.py`, you will see its a blank python file so you can write & run your code from that file.
- You can also pin `PRACTICE.py` so that your IDE opens with that file at start by default.
