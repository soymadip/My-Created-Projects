# ‚ùîHow to use(& I use) this repo?

- First fork this repo.
- Then clone your forked repo using **Git**:--
  - For Linux(Ubuntu):-
    
    ```
    sudo apt install git
    git clone https://github.com/<yourUsername>/My-Created-Projects
    ```
  - For Windows (altough I recommend to try using Linux):-
    - First install git from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    - Then clone:-
      
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/<yourUsername>/My-Created-Projects
      ```
- Now open the cloned `My-Created-Projects` folder in your IDE (I am & recomend using VS Code).
- Open the `PRACTICE.py`, you will see its a blank python file so you can write & run your code from that file.
- You can open notes,exercises,projects in new Tabs side by side (this is very efficient).
- You can also pin `PRACTICE.py` so that your IDE opens with that file at start by default.
- You can also clone my Repo directly but I recomend to fork mine first because it will give more flexibility (if I upload anything new, you can just sync upstream from GitHub..).


# ‚ÑπÔ∏èSome Tips & Sources:-
- If you are just stepping into programming world, I recommend you visiting [@CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry)'s youtube channel. He has many courses for beginners for different languages. I learn from his courses too.
- Use Replit if you don't have sufficient pc.
- My **Notes** are **not** 100% as **same** as @CodeWithHarry's Replits, I have edited them in some places for my better understanding.
- You can practice in the Practice exercises I created (although I haven't crerated much).


# ¬©Ô∏è Credits:-
- [@CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry) as most of the notes are gathered[*](https://github.com/) from his [Replits](https://replit.com/@codewithharry).
- Infinite heavenly forum users & websites I visited to gather information (sorry for not remembering all of you).
