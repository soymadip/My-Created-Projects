## ‚ùîHow to use (I use) this repo?
>I hope this repo will also be helpful to any beginner, starting his/her journey...
- First fork this repo.
- Then clone your forked repo using **Git**.
  <details>
    <summary>Steps Here</summary>
     For Linux (Debian & derivatives):-
      
      ```
      sudo apt install git
      git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/My-Practice-Environment.git
      ```
     For Windows (altough I recommend to try using Linux):-
      - First install git from [here][1]
      - Then clone:-
        
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/My-Practice-Environment.git
      ```
  </details>

- Now open the cloned `My-Created-Projects` folder in your IDE (I am & recomend using VS Code/VS Codium).
- Open the `main.py`, you will see it's a blank python file where you can write & run your code in your IDE.
- You can open notes, exercises, projects in new Tabs side by side (this is very efficient).
- You can also pin `main.py` so that your IDE opens with that file at start by default.
- You can also clone my Repo directly but I recomend to fork this repo first & then clone because it will give more flexibility (if I upload anything new, you can just sync upstream from GitHub..).


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Some Tips & Sources(that I follow):-

- [Here][2] are some useful shortcuts.
- If you are just stepping into programming world, I recommend you visiting [@CodeWithHarry][y]'s youtube channel. He has many courses for beginners for different languages. I learn from his courses.
- Use Replit if you don't have sufficient pc.
- My **Notes** are **not** as **same** as @CodeWithHarry's Replits, I have edited them for my better understanding.
- You can use the Practice exercises to practice (although I haven't crerated much).
- You can take some help from ChatGPT if you cannot find your problem in code even after hard trying. BUT DON'T GET TOO DEPENDENT AT IT.
- Learn how to use Git, it will help you in future.
- I recomend you to try & start using Linux, Linux is much more flexible than windows....
- My Desktop configuration can be found [here.]()


## ¬©Ô∏è Credits:-

- [@CodeWithHarry][y] as most of the notes of Python are gathered from his [Replits][rp].
- Infinite heavenly forum users & websites I visited to gather information (sorry for not remembering all of you).
- [Soymadip][m](Me) (I am gathering all of these myself you know üòÅ)
