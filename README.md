# üìëContents:-

- All of my practice projects and exercises which I created/will create while learning various languages..
- Notes I have gathered/will gather in future..
- [PRACTICE.py](./PRACTICE.py) for easy practice....
- .......


# ‚ùîHow to use(& I use) this repo?

- First fork this repo.
- Then clone your forked repo using **Git** :-
  - For Linux(Ubuntu):-
    
    ```
    sudo apt install git
    git clone https://github.com/<yourUsername>/My-Created-Projects
    ```
  - For Windows (altough I recommend to try using Linux):-
    - First install git from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    - Then clone:-
      
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/<yourUsername>/My-Created-Projects
      ```
- Now open the cloned `My-Created-Projects` folder in your IDE (I am & recomend using VS Code/VS Codium).
- Rename the `PRACTICE1.py` to `PRACTICE.py`, you will see it's a blank python file so you can write & run your code in that file in your IDE.
- You can open notes,exercises,projects in new Tabs side by side (this is very efficient).
- You can also pin `PRACTICE.py` so that your IDE opens with that file at start by default.
- You can also clone my Repo directly but I recomend to fork mine first because it will give more flexibility (if I upload anything new, you can just sync upstream from GitHub..).


# ‚ÑπÔ∏èSome Tips & Sources(that I follow):-

- [Here](./Useful-Shortcuts.md) are some useful shortcuts.
- If you are just stepping into programming world, I recommend you visiting [@CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry)'s youtube channel. He has many courses for beginners for different languages. I learn from his courses.
- Use Replit if you don't have sufficient pc.
- My **Notes** are **not** 100% as **same** as @CodeWithHarry's Replits, I have edited them in some places for my better understanding.
- You can use the Practice exercises to practice that I created (although I haven't crerated much).
- Learn using Git as it will help you in future.
- I recomend you to try & start using Linux, Linux is much more flexible than windows & Terminal is the best....
