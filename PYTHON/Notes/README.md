# ℹ️Here you can find @codewithharry's replit notes...


- I just re-uploaded[^1] here for better efficiency and easy searching..
[^1]: My Notes are not 100% as same as @CodeWithHarry's Replits, I have edited them in some places for my better understanding.
- My Notes are in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Format. Use/Install Obsidian to proper Formatting[^2]..
[^2]: Obsidian uses a bit of extra markdowns which are not supported in normal Markdown..
