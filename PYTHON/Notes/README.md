<h1 align="center"> Notes</h1>

- This is my Notes folder.
- These are modified[^1] @Replit `tutorial.md`s as well as other ones which I make from various sources. I upload them here for better efficiency and as backup..
- My Notes are written in [Obsidian][obs] MD Format. Use/Install [Obsidian][obs] to proper Formatting[^2]..

- Here's an example of one of my obsidian Notes:
    - Orignal note (source mode):
        <p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soymadip/My-Practice-Environment/main/Assets/exmpl1.png" width="500" height="300"></p>
    - Preview mode:
        <p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soymadip/My-Practice-Environment/main/Assets/exmpl2.png" width="500" height="300"></p>


[^1]: My Notes are not as same as @CodeWithHarry's Replits, I have edited (manyrtimes heavily), added more info in them for better understanding. You can find orignal replits [HERE][rplt]
[^2]: Obsidian uses a bit of [extra markdown rules][extr_md] like [backlinks][bkl], [highlighting][hl] & many [plugins][plgn] to easily style notes, which are not supported in normal Markdown..
