# ℹ️ Here you can find @codewithharry's modified replit notes...


- I just re-uploaded[^1] here for better efficiency and easy searching..
- My Notes are written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) MD Format. Use/Install Obsidian to proper Formatting[^2]..



[^1]: My Notes are not 100% as same as @CodeWithHarry's Replits, I have edited, added more info in them for my better understanding. You can find orignal replits [HERE](https://replit.com/@codewithharry)

[^2]: Obsidian uses a bit of extra markdown rules which are not supported in normal Markdown..
