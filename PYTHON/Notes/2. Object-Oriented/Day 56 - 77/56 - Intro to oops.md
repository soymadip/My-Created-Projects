So, in this session, we will learn about __Object Oriented Programming (OOP).__

The basic idea of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python is __to use classes and objects to represent real-world concepts and entities.__

### Object:
An object is an instance of a class, and it contains its own data and methods. 
For example, you could create a class called `"Person"` that has properties such as `name` and `age`, and _methods_ such as `speak()` and `walk().` 
Each instance of the Person class would be a unique object with its own name and age, but they would all have the same methods to speak and walk.


### Class: 
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. 
It defines the properties and methods that an object of that class will have. 


### Properties:
_Properties_ are the data or state of an object.
### Methods:
methods are the actions or behaviour that an object can perform.


### Encapsulation:
One of the key features of OOP in Python is encapsulation, 
which means that the internal state of an object is _hidden_ and can only be _accessed or modified through the object's methods_. 
- This helps to protect the object's data and prevent it from being modified in unexpected ways.


### Inheritance:
Another key feature of OOP in Python is inheritance, 
which _allows new classes to be created_ that _inherit_ the properties and methods of an existing class. 
- This allows for code reuse and makes it easy to create new classes that have similar functionality to existing classes.


###  Polymorphism:
Polymorphism is also supported in Python, 
which means that objects of different classes can be treated as if they were objects of a common class. 
- This allows for greater flexibility in code and makes it easier to write code that can work with multiple types of objects.

>[!In summary]
>OOP in Python allows developers to model real-world concepts and entities using classes and objects, encapsulate data, reuse code through inheritance, and write more flexible code through polymorphism.
