# We can also pass functions as arguments. 
> this way, we can use functions even inside a function.

> The main difference between recursion & this is that: 
> -	in __recursion__, we are_ using the same function inside a function._  
> - in **this**, we are _using another function_.

#### Example:
```python

def appl(fx, value):
  return 6 + fx(value)

double = lambda x: x * 2
cube = lambda x: x * x * x
avg = lambda x, y, z: (x + y + z) / 3     # function to calculate average.


print(appl(double , 2))

# Output:
10

```
