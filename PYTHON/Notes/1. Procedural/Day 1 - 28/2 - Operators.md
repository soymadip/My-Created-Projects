# Operators
Python has different types of operators for different operations. To create a calculator we require arithmetic operators.
# Arithmetic operators

| Operator | Operator Name  | Math sign & Example       | .   |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------------------- | --- |
| +        | Addition       | ``` 15+7 = 22 ```         | ..  |
| -        | Subtraction    | ``` 15-7 = 8 ```          | ... |
| *        | Multiplication | ``` 5*7 = 35 ```          |     |
| /        | Division       | ``` 5/3 = 1.666666667 ``` |     |
| **       | Exponential    | ``` 5^3 = 125 ```         |     |
| %        | Mudulas        | ``` 15%7 = 1 ```          |     |
| //       | Floor Division | ``` 15//7 = 2 ```         |     |

# Extra/advanced operators:
| Operator | Operator Name | Math sign                           |
| :--- :   | :---:         | :---:                               |
| +=       | Plus-Equals   | `counter+= 10` is `counter= counter+10` |
| 1b       | [âœ“]           |                                     |

## Ex:
```python
n = 15
m = 7
ans1 = n+m
print("Addition of",n,"and",m,"is", ans1)
ans2 = n-m
print("Subtraction of",n,"and",m,"is", ans2)
ans3 = n*m
print("Multiplication of",n,"and",m,"is", ans3)
ans4 = n/m
print("Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans4)
ans5 = n%m
print("Modulus of",n,"and",m,"is", ans5)
ans6 = n//m
print("Floor Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans6)
```
### Explaination
Here 'n' and 'm' are two variables in which the integer value is being stored. Variables 'ans1' , 'ans2' ,'ans3', 'ans4','ans5' and 'ans6' contains the outputs corresponding to addition, subtraction,multiplication, division, modulus and floor division respectively.
