# This is a small Python file to automatically move my backed up files to proper directories.
# In case of reseting my PC or system crash.  
# And this is my 1st code that can be used for practical/real-life Problems.üòá
# Run python3 -u "<Path to this file>"
# IF YOU WANNA USE IT, PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE USING FRESH INSTALL.
# BECAUSE THIS SCRIPT WILL CRASH OR DELETE YOUR OLD FILES IN DIRECTORIES.
