# SVG in HTML

- Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) has become an indispensable part of modern web development. 
- SVG enables developers to create high-quality, scalable graphics that look crisp at any size or resolution. 

## What is SVG?

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. Unlike raster images like PNGs or JPGs, SVGs are not pixel-based. 
They're composed of vectorsâ€”mathematical formulas that describe shapes, paths, and fills. This means SVGs can be resized without losing quality.

## Why Use SVG?

### Scalability
- SVG images can be scaled indefinitely without losing quality, which is ideal for responsive web design.
### File Size
- SVG files are often smaller than their raster counterparts, especially for simple shapes and icons.
### Flexibility
- SVGs can be styled, animated, and manipulated using CSS and JavaScript.
### complex fiels
- SVG can also be used to create more complex shapes like polygons, lines, and text.

## How to Embed SVG in HTML
SVG can be embedded in HTML in several ways:
1. Inline SVG: Directly writing the SVG XML code within HTML.
2. Using an <img> tag: Point the src attribute to an SVG file.
3. Using CSS: Setting SVG as a background image in a CSS file.
### Inline SVG Example:
```html
<svg height="100" width="100">
    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
</svg>
```
### <img> Tag Example:
```html
<img src="image.svg" alt="Sample SVG">
```
### CSS Background Example:
```css
.background {
          background-image: url('image.svg');
        }
```

## SVG Attributes
SVG comes with a set of attributes to control its behavior:
- **width and height**: To set the dimensions.
- **viewBox**: To set the coordinate system.
- **fill and stroke**: To set the colors.

## Example:

```html
<svg height="30" width="30">
    <rect width="30" height="30" style="fill:rgb(0,0,255);stroke-width:1;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)" />
</svg>
```
