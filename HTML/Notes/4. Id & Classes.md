HTML offers multiple ways to select and style elements. 
- Two of the most commonly used selectors are IDs and Classes

## What is an ID?

- An _ID is an_ **attribute**, a unique identifier assigned to only one HTML element within a page.
- It is _often used for unique styling and JavaScript manipulations_.

```html
<div id="myUniqueID">This is a div with an ID.</div>
```

## What are Classes?

- The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements. That way, you can easily change their look or behavior all at once. 
- Classes are not unique and can be assigned to multiple elements. 
- They are generally used for applying the same styles or behaviors to a group of elements.

```html
<div class="myClass">This is a div with a class.</div>
<p class="myClass">This is a paragraph with the same class.</p>
```

## Differences Between IDs and Classes

- *Uniqueness*: IDs are unique, and classes can be reused.
- *JavaScript*: IDs are often used for JavaScript operations.
- *Styling*: Both can be used for styling, but IDs have higher specificity.
