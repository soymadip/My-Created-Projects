An HTML element is a complete set that consists of a start tag (or opening tag), content, and an end tag (or closing tag).
<p align="center"><b>HTML Element = Start Tag + Content + End Tag</b></a>

Example:
```html
<h1>This is our first heading</h1>
```
In this example, `<h1>` is the start tag, "This is our first heading" is the content, and `</h1>` is the end tag. Together, they form an HTML element.

2. Block elements

## Inline Elements

Inline Elements don't start on a new line. It only takes the width required to cover the content. They are part of the flow within other elements.
- Inline elements can contain other inline elements, 
- But they generally shouldn't contain block-level elements which can lead to unexpected behavior in terms of layout and styling.

### Common Inline Elements: 
![[elements_inline.png]]

- `<span>`: A generic inline container for text
- `<a>`: Defines a hyperlink
- `<strong>`: Defines important text
- `<em>`: Defines emphasized text<img>: Embeds an image
- `<input>`: Defines an input control
- `<select>`: Drop down list
- `<button>`: Buttons.
- Some [[5a. Short list of HTML Tags#Text Formatting Tags|Text Formatting Tags]] like `<b>` `<i>` `<u>` etc.

## Block Elements:
Block-level elements are those that start on a new line and take up the entire width of their container by default.
They essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves, pushing any content that comes after them to a new line.
Block Elements:
- Always start on a new line.
- Take up the full width available.
- Width and height can be controlled via CSS.
- Can contain other block-level as well as inline elements.

- `<address>`

## What is a Nested HTML Element?

A nested HTML element is an HTML structure where one element is placed inside another element.
- The enclosing element is often referred to as the "parent,"
- while the enclosed element is called the "child."

<p align="center"><b>Nested HTML Element = One HTML Element Inside Another HTML Element</b></a>

For example:

```markup
<h1><b>This is our first heading</b></h1>
```
In this example, the `<b>` element (child) is nested inside the `<h1>` element (parent).


## What is an Empty HTML Element?

An empty HTML element is one that does not have a closing tag or content. These elements are also known as "void elements" or "self-closing elements".

<p align="center"><b>Empty HTML Element = Tags with No Content</b></p>

For example:
```html
<br/>
```
This is a **break tag**, which has no content and no closing tag. It's used to insert a line break within text or other inline elements.
